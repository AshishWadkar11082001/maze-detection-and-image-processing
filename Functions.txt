def detect_traffic_signals(maze_image):

	Purpose: This function takes the image as an argument and returns a list ofnodes in which traffic signals are present in the image

	Input Arguments: `maze_image` :	[ numpy array ]  
				numpy array of image returned by cv2 library
	Returns: `traffic_signals` : [ list ]
	    	    list containing nodes in which traffic signals are present



def detect_horizontal_roads_under_construction(maze_image):

	Purpose: This function takes the image as an argument and returns a list containing the missing horizontal links

	Input Arguments: `maze_image` :	[ numpy array ]
				numpy array of image returned by cv2 library
	Returns: `horizontal_roads_under_construction` : [ list ]
		    list containing missing horizontal links


def detect_vertical_roads_under_construction(maze_image):

	Purpose: This function takes the image as an argument and returns a list containing the missing vertical links

	Input Arguments: `maze_image` :	[ numpy array ]
				numpy array of image returned by cv2 library
	Returns: `vertical_roads_under_construction` : [ list ]
		   list containing missing vertical links



def detect_medicine_packages(maze_image):

	Purpose: This function takes the image as an argument and returns a nested list of details of the medicine packages placed in different shops

	Input Arguments: `maze_image` :	[ numpy array ]
				numpy array of image returned by cv2 library
	Returns: `medicine_packages` : [ list ]
		      nested list containing details of the medicine packages present.
			Each element of this list will contain 
			- Shop number as Shop_n
			- Color of the package as a string
			- Shape of the package as a string



  def detect_arena_parameters(maze_image):

	Purpose: This function takes the image as an argument and returns a dictionary containing the details of the different arena parameters in that image

	The arena parameters are of four categories:
	i) traffic_signals : list of nodes having a traffic signal
	ii) horizontal_roads_under_construction : list of missing horizontal links
	iii) vertical_roads_under_construction : list of missing vertical links
	iv) medicine_packages : list containing details of medicine packages

	These four categories constitute the four keys of the dictionary

	Input Arguments: `maze_image` :	[ numpy array ]
				numpy array of image returned by cv2 library
	Returns: `arena_parameters` : { dictionary }
		    dictionary containing details of the arena parameters
